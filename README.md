# Hey there! I'm Lokie-codes, the code wizard

I may not have a long white beard, but I do have a pretty impressive arsenal of programming languages at my disposal. C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript are all in my wheelhouse, and I'm no slouch when it comes to web development frameworks like Django and Flask either.

## Skills

- The ability to turn a jumbled mess of code into something that actually works (most of the time)
- A love of debugging (who doesn't love tracking down pesky errors?)
- The power of positive thinking (I may have lost a few hairs from pulling them out, but I always believe that the solution is just around the corner)

## Experience

- I've been a software developer for a while now, working on all sorts of projects for a variety of clients
- I've learned a lot along the way and am always looking for new challenges to tackle

## Hobbies and Interests

- Staying up late to finish a project (caffeine is my friend)
- Participating in hackathons (because who doesn't love a good coding competition?)
- Hiking and spending time outdoors (to balance out all the time I spend in front of a computer)

Thanks for checking out my profile! If you have any questions or want to work together, don't be afraid to reach out.
